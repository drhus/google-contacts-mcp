# Google Contacts Skill - Setup Guide

## Quick Start

The contacts skill has been created with full CRUD operations for Google Contacts. It shares authentication with your calendar skill.

## Re-authorization Required

Since the Google Contacts scope has been upgraded from readonly to full access (read/write), you need to re-authorize once.

### Step 1: Delete Existing Token

```bash
rm ~/.claude/.google/token.json
```

This will force re-authorization with the new scopes.

### Step 2: Run Any Contacts Operation

```bash
~/.claude/skills/contacts/scripts/contacts_manager.rb --list
```

This will:
1. Detect missing token
2. Open your browser to Google's authorization page
3. Start a local redirect server on port 8080
4. Automatically capture the authorization code when you approve

### Step 3: Authorize in Browser

1. Your browser will open automatically to Google's consent screen
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Grant permissions for:
   - Google Calendar access (shared token)
   - Google Contacts access (read and write)
4. After approving, the browser redirects to `localhost:8080` and the token is saved automatically

The token will be saved to `~/.claude/.google/token.json` and will be used by both:
- Calendar skill (`~/.claude/skills/calendar/`)
- Contacts skill (`~/.claude/skills/contacts/`)

## Verify Setup

Test the skill with a simple search:

```bash
~/.claude/skills/contacts/scripts/contacts_manager.rb --search "your name"
```

You should see JSON output with your contact information.

## What's Included

### Scripts
- `contacts_manager.rb` - Full CRUD operations for Google Contacts

### References
- `contact_fields.md` - Comprehensive field documentation

### Capabilities
- ✅ Search contacts by name
- ✅ Get full contact details
- ✅ List all contacts with pagination
- ✅ Create new contacts (all fields: names, emails, phones, org, URLs, addresses, birthday, notes)
- ✅ Update existing contacts
- ✅ Delete contacts
- ✅ Update contact photos (from URL or local file)
- ✅ List contact groups/labels
- ✅ Add contacts to groups

### Supported Fields
- Names (first, last, display)
- Emails (multiple, with types)
- Phone numbers (multiple, with types)
- Addresses (physical, with types)
- Organizations (company, title)
- Birthdays
- Notes/Biography
- URLs
- And more (see `references/contact_fields.md`)

## Integration

### With Other Skills
If you have a calendar or email skill that shares the same OAuth token (`~/.claude/.google/token.json`), they will work seamlessly together — no re-auth needed.

## Usage Examples

See `SKILL.md` for comprehensive usage examples including:
- Searching contacts
- Creating contacts with all fields
- Updating specific fields
- Batch operations
- Workflow patterns

## Troubleshooting

### Scope Errors
If you see "insufficient permissions" errors:

```bash
# Check current scopes
cat ~/.claude/.google/token.json | python3 -m json.tool | grep scope

# Should show both:
# - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar
# - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/contacts
```

### Re-authorization
If authentication fails, simply delete the token and re-run:

```bash
rm ~/.claude/.google/token.json
~/.claude/skills/contacts/scripts/contacts_manager.rb --list
```

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Complete re-authorization (Steps 1-4 above)
2. ✅ Test basic search operation
3. ✅ Try creating a test contact
4. ✅ Explore all operations in `SKILL.md`
5. ✅ Use the skill in Claude Code conversations
